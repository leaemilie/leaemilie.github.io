        <p>"A charming <strong>treasure of the Caribbean </strong>where enthusiastic culture meets breathtaking landscape."<br><br>
          Silky winds, vibrant golden sun and sparkling waters merge to raise a truly diverse mixture of exotic spices. In Sint Maarten, all your dreams can come true. Miles of powdery sandy beach, scornful Calypso King and feathery costumes during Carnival Season, as well as the rich French Caribbean cuisine: all possibilities are limitless on <strong>"The Friendly Island"</strong>. You are free to live in the moment, explore endlessly and indulge continuously.<br><br>
          With cultural heritage rooted back to mostly Europe and Africa, Sint Maarten has created a vibrant mosaic of <strong>70 different rich cultures</strong>. Diversity does not stop in how many languages are spoken on the island: English, Dutch, French, Creole, Spanish, Papiamento and many other languages.  On the Dutch side, English is the most frequently used language, but Dutch is still taught in schools. The French side mostly consists of Francophone presence.  Yet, <strong>English </strong>is widely spoken by most parts of the island.<br><br>
          Exploration is a way of life in Sint Maarten. From miles of Emerald landscapes with breathtaking auburn sunsets, duty free shopping, annual yacht racing events like the Heineken Regatta, to exotic nightlife and casino, there is no a unique way to explore the island. All you need to consider is how you wish to uncover this Caribbean beauty.<br><br>

        <div class="history-grid">

        <p>The island changed hands many times between the <strong>Spanish, British, Dutch </strong>and <strong>French </strong>powers. The old stone forts, which guard many of the islands inlets, are proof of the island’s turbulent past.
        Traces of Stone Age settlements dating back to 4,000 BC have been found. Around 800 AD, most Caribbean islands, including Sint Maarten, were settled by Arawak Indians who arrived from South America to settle down to a life of fishing, hunting and farming.<br><br>
        However, in the 14th century, the cannibalistic Carib Indians followed the Arawak Indians. They were a much more war-like tribe and named the island <strong>Soualiga</strong>, which means “Salt Island”. This was due to its main mineral deposit. In fact, remains of the Great Salt Pond can still be seen in Philipsburg today.<br><br>
        Legend says that Sint Maarten receives its name from the day <strong>Christopher Columbus</strong> landed on the island. That was on <strong>November 11th 1493,</strong> the holy day of St. Martin of Tours which is now Sint Maarten's day too. <br><br>
        After multiple battles for ownership of the island between the three colonial powers, the <strong>Dutch </strong>and <strong>French</strong> agreed to divide the island in 1648 after driving out the Spanish. Over the next few years, the boundary was the subject of numerous disputes, which were not settled until <strong>1817</strong>. In this timeframe the island changed hands between the two powers 16 times.<br><br>
        On <strong>October 10th, 2010</strong> the Dutch side of Sint Maarten gained its <strong>independence</strong> as a country within the Netherland Kingdom; just like sister islands Aruba (1986) and Curacao (2010).<br><br>

        <h2 id="nightlife">Nightlife</h2>
        <p>The adventure never stops in Sint Maarten and the fun from the daytime carries into the night effortlessly with the numerous locations and events happening all year round. Most of the night events take place on the Dutch side where clubs and bars gladly welcome customers but on special holidays like Carnival or New Years eve, the two sides provide opportunities for everyone to enjoy a good time. Party animals find their feat on the island that never sleeps. The perfect night starts in one of the local restaurants where travelers and locals alike enjoy the most delicious food before heading to bars, karaoke venues and casinos. Party goers wait until 1 to 2am before headind to the night clubs in Simpson Bay where they'll dance their heart out until being kicked out at 4am. The more daring ones will end their night in strip clubs before eating a hearty breakfast at the Sunset Beach Bar and Restaurant where they will enjoy watching a beautiful sunset that sends them to bed. Following night: repeat! </p>
